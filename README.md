# AlgoToolbox
Guide for the Algorithmic toolbox course on Coursera.<br/>
Generally while doing online courses, most of us don't bother to go through the reading materials in depth and just complete the course after watching the videos and by solving the assignments. This is generally a really bad practice which can hamper one's learning process unless they already know the theory parts related to the course.<br/>

I've made this repository to document what I've learned through this course.</br>
If you're enrolled in this course, it's my suggestion that "**please go through the course materials and do not blindly copy assignment codes!!!**"<br/>
That's all. Happy Coding :wink: <br/>

The course contents are as follows:
  # **Week 1**
  - Sum of two integers
  - Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
  
  # **Week 2**
  - Fibonacci Numbers (and implementation of Pisano period)
  - Big-O Notation Visualisation (Jupyter Notebook)
  - GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) Calculation
  - LCM using GCD
